# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using the new integrated blog system! The blog posts are written in Markdown and automatically appear in the Log menu section of the XMB interface.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in clean, simple Markdown
- **XMB Integration**: Posts appear directly in the navigation menu
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile
- **Clean Interface**: Maintains the PS3 XMB aesthetic

## Getting Started

To add new blog posts, simply create `.md` files in the `blog/` folder with frontmatter containing:

- `title`: The post title that appears in the menu
- `date`: Publication date
- `excerpt`: Short description (optional)

Happy blogging!
